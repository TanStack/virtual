        Please add a link to a minimal reproduction.
        Note:
          - Your bug may get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.
          - To create a shareable code example for web, you can use CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) or Stackblitz (https://stackblitz.com/).
          - Please make sure the example is complete and runnable without prior dependencies and free of unnecessary abstractions
          - Feel free to fork any of the official CodeSandbox examples to reproduce your issue: https://github.com/tanstack/virtual/tree/main/examples/
          - For React Native, you can use: https://snack.expo.dev/
          - For TypeScript related issues only, a TypeScript Playground link might be sufficient: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play
          - Please read these tips for providing a minimal example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.
